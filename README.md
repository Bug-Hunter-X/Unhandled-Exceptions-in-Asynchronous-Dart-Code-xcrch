# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common issue in asynchronous Dart programming: inadequate handling of exceptions in `async` functions. The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from a remote API. The code includes a `try-catch` block, but it could be improved for better error handling and reporting.

The `bugSolution.dart` file shows an improved version with more robust error handling, providing more context to exceptions and potentially more graceful fallback mechanisms. This improved example showcases better practices for managing network requests and data processing in Dart.
